Create a brand guide that takes what you have learned about branding and identity into consideration and present this in a neatly formatted PDF document.
Your document must contain graphics as well as text explaining the graphics.

At it's simplest the document must set out to contexualize and justify the following elements,

1. Short statement outlining the mission or purpose of the site and defining its audience
2. A logo 
3. Color palette
4. Headline and body fonts
5. Guidelines for use of photography
6. Copywriting guidelines
7. Additional design elements (glyphs, textures, shapes eg info, arrows etc)

Ensure that your submission is well formatted with a cover page, neatly presented and easy to read.

All photography should be natural and rustic in order to keep and wildlife feel, as for text there should be no serif fonts.
Shapes should be rough and/or rounded and info should be written in a care free light hearted manner.
